This repository contains the main data files associated to the synthetic test case considered in the article "Conditioning multi-Gaussian groundwater flow parameters to transient hydraulic head and flowrate data with iterative ensemble smoothers: a synthetic case study" accepted for publication in Frontiers in Earth Science (DOI: 10.3389/feart.2020.00202). 

These files are:
- the hydraulic conductivity values [m/s], stacked in one column, of the reference field of dimensions 50 x 500; 
- the synthetic head data [m]. Each column corresponds to the time series at one observation location in the order of the
location numbering shown in Figure 1;
- the synthetic flowrate data [m^3/s]. Each column corresponds to the time series associated to each one the five zones 
defined from the bottom to the top of the western boundary.

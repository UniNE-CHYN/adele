This repository contains the main data files associated to the synthetic test case addressed in the manuscript "Conditioning multi-Gaussian groundwater flow parameters to transient hydraulic head and flowrate data with iterative ensemble smoothers: a synthetic case study" currently under revision for publication in Frontiers in Earth Science, section Hydrosphere. 

These files are:
- the stacked log hydraulic conductivity values from the simulated reference field of dimensions 50 x 500;
- the synthetic head data [m]. Each column corresponds to the time series at one observation location in the order of the
location numbering shown in Figure 1;
- the synthetic flowrate data [m^3/s]. Each column corresponds to the time series associated to each one the five zones 
defined from the bottom to the top of the western boundary.
